# Professional Readme Generator
## Discription
This is a node.js app that allows the user to create a readme.md file for thier projects.
- I was motivated to create this to gain experience using the inquirer package and prompt module.
- I built this project to practice and demonstrate node.js, nmp, and javascript.
- I solved problems using arrow functions, destructuring objects, npm, fs module, and node.js, importing and exporting from javascript files.
- I learn't about how to use node.js to create a command line application.
